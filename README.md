Transmitter and Receiver code for the laser transmission system

Transmits 16 characters via clock and data lasers from one to the other (one way).
Just a demonstration project, but cool nonetheless.
Could have been made faster, better, more robust, further range etc. with better materials, but I made do.

How I made the hardware: <a href= "https://www.instructables.com/id/Laser-Transmission-With-Arduinos/" > Instructable </a>

Will post schematics later
In the mean time heres a random image of a dog.
